# Made for MSFS2024 and may work in MSFS2020 

# Version 0.6
 # SETUP ITEMS: THESE MUST HAPPEN PRIOR TO JOINING SESSION
   - WEATHER needs to match. Please ensure both airplanes are showing the correct Altitude that matches based onthe weather before Joining the session.
   - Please Disable KNOB ACCELERATTION in the RJ EFB or the altitude and other knobs will get way out of synch.
   - Please ensure all items on the EFB CONFIGURATION are selected to match on both EFB's.
   - Please ensure weaight and balance, fuel, etc are matched manually as someitems on EFB will not synch
 # KNOWN ISSUES
   - 11/28/2024
    - EFB - GND PWR, GND STAIR, and GND AIR buttons do not work, you will have to push on both pilots EFB's 
    - ENGINE start Switch works, but you need to hold in Start position for a second or two for it to synch to second pilot
    - LVLCHG and THRUST Lights May not be synching properly. Ihave seen mixed results on this
    - MAN RATE btn is finicky. You may have to have second pilot disconnect, then seet the MAN RATE btn to match then join the session again to keep synch.
